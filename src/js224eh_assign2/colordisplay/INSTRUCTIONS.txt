Exercise 7
===========
Write a GUI program ColorDisplay.java. When the button ”Display Color” is
pressed, three integers (red, green, blue) are read and the color of the upper
pane is changed according to the values of the integers. Use three components of
the type TextField to read the integers.
The picture below shows how the execution of the program can look.

_[program mockup]_

If erroneous values of the integers are read, an error message should be printed
and the upper pane should not be updated. The most important thing is that the
program is working properly. It is also important for the program to have a good
structure to make it easy to follow and to understand. Divide big methods and
big classes into smaller ones, if necessary.
