/*
 * Exercise 3
 * ==========
 * Write a program SumMain, that includes a recursive method computing the sum
 * of the integers 1, 2, 3, ..., N.
 * The computation should be based on the following principle: the sum of the
 * integers from 1 to N is equal to the sum of the integers from 1 to N/2 added
 * with the sum of the integers from N/2+1 to N.
 * Is this a good solution strategy? Motivate your answer!
 */

/*
 * ANSWER
 * ======
 * The algorithm does not seem hopelessly slow.
 * I did some experiments and generated a plot of the number of method calls
 * as a function of N, for N from 1 to 10000.
 *
 * The graph is included in this folder as "sumMain_n-from-1-to-10000_graph.png".
 * I also did some very simple curve-fitting, and it seems that the number of
 * method calls is not linear to N, but it is not as bad as exponential or some
 * kind of power law either.
 *
 * I am vaguely familiar with this kind of algorithm.
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_conquer_algorithm
 *
 * But I lack the math skills necessary to dig much deeper into this.
 * I'd guess to say that each comparison takes the same amount of time.
 *
 * This method results in many simple computations of small numbers.
 * I have a feeling this _might_ linearize the execution time, as compared to
 * calculating the sum with a simple traversal and continuous increment of a
 * running tally. The running sum would grow to become a very large number
 * that might require more than a single CPU/JavaVM instruction to process.
 * On second thought, maybe this wouldn't happen for < 64-bit numbers ..
 *
 * I'd say it is a convoluted solution for this simple problem.
 * The divide and conquer apporach fits other kinds of problems better and
 * is probably even required to solve some of them.
 * Instinctively, I would prefer to calculate the sum using a simpler method.
 *
 * But it is tough to determine the suitability of a solution without a
 * greater context and/or some defined set of requirements.
